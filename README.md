# Files

Files is a file management application for the Nintendo 3DS.

It is currently in pre-alpha (so this means its not finished).

## Features

* Material Design
* Allows you to view files
* Did I mention Material Design
* Over-engineered code base that will probably be split into a library soon

## Dependencies

* FreeType from portlibs (which depends on libpng and zlib)
* Citro3D
* Ctrulib
